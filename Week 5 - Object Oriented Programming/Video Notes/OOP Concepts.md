**Objects have properties & methods (functionality).**

**DVD Player**

### Four pillars of OOP:

1.  **Abstraction**: Exposing the essential features of an entity or object while hiding the details that don't really matter or that change between implementations.
    -   Triangle - we know the properties that make a triangle, but it's an abstract concept
2.  **Encapsulation**: Hiding the inner workings of our code so that certain methods are only accessible to certain areas of the code. Makes sure code isn't used or changed in way's that we don't want.
    -   Driving a car - user doesn't need to know how the car works under the hood, but is able to make the car work by using the public properties
3.  **Inheritance**: Allows objects or classes to inherit from parent classes.
4.  **Polymorphism**: something can take different forms.
    -   Different types of animals can communicate, but they do it in different ways
    -   The "method" communicate can take different forms
    
### A **class** is how we structure our code in object oriented programming.
-   A **class** is like a blueprint.
-   An **object** is the actual product developed from the blueprint.
-   An **object** is an instance of a class.
